I managed to get it installed... just clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors.git
# Then cd into the directory it just created

cd elegance-colors
# and run the command to checkout the v2.9 tag

git checkout v2.9
# Once you do that, you should be able to run

make

# without issue. It will display a warning, but you can still run

sudo make install
# to install it to your system.
